# Oberon public ingress activation

The checked-in values use `.invalid` and cannot expose traffic accidentally.
Before activation, create a private environment overlay that replaces the
domain in the IngressController, wildcard Route, Launchpad ConfigMap and Oberon
cluster registry entry. Store `ACCESS_BROKER_KEY` in
`partner-ai-launchpad/launchpad-public-access`; do not commit it.

Activation order:

1. Provision a public load balancer/WAF and wildcard DNS.
2. Install the browser-trusted wildcard certificate Secret in
   `openshift-ingress`.
3. Install `rhbk-operator.yaml` and wait for the Red Hat Build of Keycloak
   Operator to report `Succeeded` in its dedicated `keycloak` namespace.
4. Apply `oberon-ingresscontroller.yaml` with the real values and wait for
   Available.
5. Configure Keycloak and OpenShift OIDC.
6. Render and review `overlays/oberon-public`; then deploy it.
7. Run DNS, TLS, isolation, browser, authorization and cleanup certification.

Do not set `public_access_enabled: true` for Oberon until all steps pass.

Oberon currently uses a single HostNetwork router on its only node. Do not
apply the sample `LoadBalancerService` IngressController until an external
load balancer/WAF and a reachable isolated endpoint have been designed. A
second router cannot share the default router's node ports on this topology.
The existing OSAC development Keycloak is unrelated and must not be reused.

The Keycloak authenticator image is built from `keycloak-authenticator/`.
`keycloak.yaml`, `keycloak-flow-config.json`, and `openshift-oauth-idp.yaml` are
merge templates, not directly deployable replacements. Back up the live
Keycloak/OAuth resources and merge only the described provider/client/flow.
Run `scripts/certify_public_access.py --host <test-order-host>` from an external
network and retain its immutable output in the certification evidence bundle.
