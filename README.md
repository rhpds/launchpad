# Intel x Red Hat AI Partner Launchpad

Launchpad is an internal self-service lab platform running on the **Arena OpenShift cluster**. It provisions individual environments and multi-seat workshops, validates them before handoff, exposes participant access, and reclaims generated resources at the end of a session.

Its target operating model is self-service at both layers: users and CIs can
request or contribute governed experiences, while the platform detects and
recovers from known low-risk failures through evidence-gated automation. Novel,
security-sensitive, cluster-scoped, and high-impact actions remain human
approved. See the
[self-service and auto-remediation operating model](docs/self-service-and-autoremediation.md).

Public passwordless participant access is implemented behind a fail-closed
release gate. See [public lab access](docs/PUBLIC_ACCESS.md) for persona flows,
infrastructure prerequisites, contracts and certification evidence.

## Start here

New participants, instructors, content integrators (CIs), tenant owners,
platform operators, and developers should begin with the
[persona onboarding guide](docs/persona-onboarding.md). It defines access
boundaries, first-use workflows, the CI delivery contract, testing and
certification expectations, and the evidence to provide when requesting help.
New catalog experiences use the repository-native
[catalog onboarding pipeline](docs/catalog-onboarding.md) so source validation,
catalog generation, Antora builds, and evidence receipts are repeatable.
An existing quickstart Git repository can now be discovered into a fail-closed
intake before entering the same review and 1/5/25 certification pipeline.

Pilot presenters and operators should also use the
[demo walkthrough](docs/presenter-demo-walkthrough.md),
[ecosystem architecture and product roadmap](docs/ecosystem-architecture-roadmap.md),
the [presentation source](docs/presentations/launchpad-ecosystem-demo.md),
the [template-based PowerPoint deck](docs/presentations/launchpad-ecosystem-demo-gcl-template.pptx), and
[support runbook](docs/support-runbook.md). The current TDD/EDD/CDD/BDD/CBT
status is recorded in the
[ecosystem enablement proof matrix](docs/ecosystem-enablement-proof-matrix.md).
The portable
[ecosystem playbooks](deploy/ecosystem/README.md) wrap the approved deployment,
remote registration, validation, and group-reclaim paths without changing the
workstation's Kubernetes context.

Quick paths:

- **Participant:** open the assigned ready session, then use its Visual Guide
  and Live Workspace.
- **Instructor:** order one multi-seat workshop, verify capacity, wait for every
  seat to become ready, distribute seat-specific links, and reclaim after use.
- **Content integrator:** keep the catalog definition, Antora/AsciiDoc Showroom
  content, tests, and deployable resources in this repository; submit them for
  review and certification.
- **Operator:** use the admin dashboard and cluster-aware runbooks; production
  promotion and shared Operator/model management are administrative actions.

## Current deployment

| Surface | URL |
|---|---|
| Partner portal | <https://launchpad.apps.arena.fm2aihpcsed.com> |
| Admin dashboard | <https://launchpad-admin.apps.arena.fm2aihpcsed.com> |
| Backend API | <https://launchpad-api.apps.arena.fm2aihpcsed.com> |
| Public participant gateway | <https://labs.smg-helix.ai> |

The portal and API are protected by OpenShift OAuth. The deployment is managed by the `launchpad` Argo CD Application using `deploy/launchpad/overlays/arena`.

### Lifecycle HA and Flightpath DR

The repository now contains a feature-gated durable lifecycle worker design for
provisioning, validation, TTL, reconciliation, and reclaim. PostgreSQL-backed
leases and monotonically increasing fencing tokens keep one worker responsible
for a session or workshop, while the operations view reports queue health,
retries, takeovers, and stuck cleanup. The base remains disabled; the candidate
Arena activation shape is `deploy/launchpad/overlays/arena-ha-pilot`.

Flightpath is registered only as an inactive control-plane DR standby. Its
overlay renders all Deployments at zero replicas and suspends CronJobs so it
cannot become a second writer by accident. Promotion requires a hard Arena
fence, verified data/secret restoration, and staged validation. See the
[Flightpath DR runbook](docs/flightpath-dr-runbook.md) and the current
[HA/DR certification matrix](docs/ha-dr-certification-20260908.md). Neither
overlay has been applied to a live cluster by this change.

## Supported user journeys

### Individual environment

Use **Request Environment → Individual Lab** to provision one catalog item for one user.

### Multi-seat workshop

Use **Request Environment → Multi-seat Workshop** to order one workshop containing 1–25 isolated participant seats. Launchpad performs a capacity preview before confirmation, provisions seats concurrently, requires collective endpoint stability before declaring the workshop ready, and supports failed-seat retry and group reclaim.

### OpenShift Developer Sandbox

The `ai-sandbox` catalog item is OpenShift-first. Its primary access is the real OpenShift Console scoped to the generated namespace, with Web Terminal and browser IDE access where available. The requester receives the namespace-level `edit` role; Launchpad does not grant cluster-admin. Jupyter is not a default access method.

The shared Arena platform provides the centrally managed OpenShift capabilities used by catalog experiences. A sandbox or guided lab order receives namespace-scoped access and does not install cluster-wide operators.

The request form shows the live healthy model inventory and permits multiple
model selections. Models remain centrally served behind LiteLLM; the sandbox
receives scoped API access and does not load model weights into its pod.

## Active file-backed catalog

| ID | Name | Category |
|---|---|---|
| `ai-sandbox` | OpenShift Developer Sandbox | Open sandbox |
| `cpu-inference-serving` | LLM CPU Serving on Xeon | Quick start |
| `intel-llm-cpu-serving` | Intel AI Quickstart: Serve LLMs on Intel Xeon CPUs | Guided build |
| `intel-llm-tool-calling` | Intel AI Quickstart: LLM Tool Calling on Intel | Guided build |
| `intel-xeon6-agent-201` | Intel Xeon 6 201: Building an AI Agent | Guided build |
| `multi-agent-quickstart` | Build Multi-Agent AI Systems with Open Protocols | Guided build |
| `openshift-operators-workshop` | OpenShift AI Operator Workshop | Guided build |
| `rag-on-xeon` | RAG on Intel Xeon | Quick start |
| `smoke-test` | Smoke Test Demo | Quick start |

Catalog definitions live under `catalog/*/catalog-item.yaml`. The previous `guided-rag-on-xeon` item is deprecated; new workshop orders use the operator-focused experience.

Draft onboarding candidates are registered but intentionally hidden from the
order flow until runtime and live certification gates pass:

| ID | Name | Current gate |
|---|---|---|
| `agentops-observability` | AgentOps in Production: End-to-End Observability with Red Hat AI | Five internal seats are GREEN-live with isolated concurrent journeys and zero-residue normal/fault reclaim; 25-seat capacity, public access, and production Logging/TLS remain gated |

`multi-agent-quickstart` is active for orders up to 25 seats. One lab contains
local, hands-on OpenShift, and advanced blueprint tracks. Optional advanced
integrations and durable image supply remain later hardening work; the current
pilot boundary is maintained in the September readiness documents.

Launchpad has adapters for mock, local, direct OpenShift, and RHDP modes.
**Direct OpenShift mode is the deployed Arena path.** RHDP/AgnosticD integration
remains repository capability and a useful source contract for importing labs;
it is not the runtime control plane for the internal Intel deployment. The
AgentOps import analysis is in
[docs/agentops-rhdp-gap-analysis.md](docs/agentops-rhdp-gap-analysis.md).
The native Multi-Agent Quickstart intake and promotion gates are in
[docs/multi-agent-quickstart-import.md](docs/multi-agent-quickstart-import.md).

The September 17 internal event target remains 25 Multi-Agent seats, 25 Serve
LLMs seats, and 25 Building an AI Agent seats. Provisioning is staggered, every
workshop stays wholly on its assigned cluster, and all 75 environments must
remain available concurrently through one Launchpad entry point. The exact
combined rehearsal and capacity gate are tracked in
[docs/september-17-agentic-three-workshop-readiness.md](docs/september-17-agentic-three-workshop-readiness.md).
The durable lifecycle queue now enforces one active workshop-provision job
fleet-wide. Organizers may submit later orders, but they remain queued until
the preceding workshop finishes; reclaim and individual-session lifecycle jobs
remain eligible.
Historical September 8–9 rehearsals proved three provision/reclaim cycles and
one 60-minute retained-topology soak. The current retained orders were tested
again on September 9: all 75 overlapping participant journeys passed, followed
by a 10-minute 10/10 steady-state soak. The current exact burst is nevertheless
RED for resilience because `gnr2` carried 213 pods and 511 running containers,
node-wide probe timeouts restarted one ingress router, and `rhgnr1` remained
deliberately cordoned. Qualify the second worker and repeat the exact burst
before treating this topology as the event candidate. Public DNS/TLS and OIDC
configuration now use the permanent `labs.smg-helix.ai` named tunnel. One
Serve LLMs participant completed the claim, resume, Showroom, terminal,
AnythingLLM, inference, isolation, and logout journey; 25 simultaneous public
claims and worker-level resilience remain separate gates. The current matrix,
rubric, and manual acceptance boundary are in
[docs/september-17-pilot-status-20260908.md](docs/september-17-pilot-status-20260908.md).

```

Generated CI receipts are uploaded as workflow artifacts and are not committed.
Historical proof remains immutable until its hash and reference chain has been
migrated deliberately. See the
[repository hygiene policy](docs/repository-hygiene.md) before moving or
deleting catalogs, evidence, demo assets, or historical documents.

## Development and verification

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest -q backend/tests

cd frontend
npm test -- --run
npm run build
```

New catalog experiences must include tests for their schema, request contract,
provisioning plan, functional validation, Showroom journey, and deterministic
cleanup. Follow the staged CI checklist in
[docs/persona-onboarding.md](docs/persona-onboarding.md#content-integrator-ci-onboarding)
and declare new sources through
[docs/catalog-onboarding.md](docs/catalog-onboarding.md).

Use the reusable certification runner to prove the same lifecycle for every
onboarded catalog item. Planning is read-only; `run` creates one workshop order,
waits for every seat, executes the lab-specific probe concurrently, reclaims the
order, and writes sanitized JSON plus a SHA-256 manifest:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/catalog_certification.py plan \
  certification/catalog/<catalog-id>.yaml --seats 25

KUBECONFIG=/path/to/arena-kubeconfig \
LAUNCHPAD_ADMIN_API_KEY='set-outside-git' \
.venv/bin/python scripts/catalog_certification.py run \
  certification/catalog/<catalog-id>.yaml \
  --seats 25 \
  --api-base-url https://launchpad-api.apps.arena.fm2aihpcsed.com \
  --tenant-id <certification-tenant> \
  --owner-id <operator> \
  --run-id <unique-proof-run>
```

Never put the API key in the command line, contract, logs, or evidence.

Use Arena's dedicated kubeconfig for every cluster command; do not change the current kubeconfig context:

```bash
KUBECONFIG=/Users/jkershaw/.kube/config-arena oc ...
```

## Current limitations

- Existing Guided RAG sessions retain their original content; new orders use the OpenShift AI Operator Workshop.
- Operator availability is cluster-wide and centrally managed; catalog items should detect and use installed capabilities rather than install an Operator per participant seat.
- Some older files in `docs/` describe the original RHDP/infra01 target. Files explicitly labeled **historical** are design references, not the current Intel deployment contract.
- Repository-wide lint currently includes pre-existing React purity errors in `BrandingContext.tsx` and `Fleet.tsx`.

performance, ETA, automation, and scale pathways are tracked in
[docs/next-iteration-roadmap.md](docs/next-iteration-roadmap.md). For adapter
behavior, see [docs/adapters.md](docs/adapters.md). StarGate, DeepField, and
GeoLux production-candidate paths are defined in
