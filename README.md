# Intel x Red Hat AI Partner Launchpad

Launchpad is an internal self-service lab platform running on the **Arena OpenShift cluster**. It provisions individual environments and multi-seat workshops, validates them before handoff, exposes participant access, and reclaims generated resources at the end of a session.

Its target operating model is self-service at both layers: users and CIs can
request or contribute governed experiences, while the platform detects and
recovers from known low-risk failures through evidence-gated automation. Novel,
security-sensitive, cluster-scoped, and high-impact actions remain human
approved. See the
[self-service and auto-remediation operating model](docs/self-service-and-autoremediation.md).

Public passwordless participant access is implemented behind a fail-closed
release gate. See [public lab access](docs/PUBLIC_ACCESS.md) for persona flows,
infrastructure prerequisites, contracts and certification evidence.

## Start here

New participants, instructors, content integrators (CIs), tenant owners,
platform operators, and developers should begin with the
[persona onboarding guide](docs/persona-onboarding.md). It defines access
boundaries, first-use workflows, the CI delivery contract, testing and
certification expectations, and the evidence to provide when requesting help.
New catalog experiences use the repository-native
[catalog onboarding pipeline](docs/catalog-onboarding.md) so source validation,
catalog generation, Antora builds, and evidence receipts are repeatable.

Quick paths:

- **Participant:** open the assigned ready session, then use its Visual Guide
  and Live Workspace.
- **Instructor:** order one multi-seat workshop, verify capacity, wait for every
  seat to become ready, distribute seat-specific links, and reclaim after use.
- **Content integrator:** keep the catalog definition, Antora/AsciiDoc Showroom
  content, tests, and deployable resources in this repository; submit them for
  review and certification.
- **Operator:** use the admin dashboard and cluster-aware runbooks; production
  promotion and shared Operator/model management are administrative actions.

## Current deployment

| Surface | URL |
|---|---|
| Partner portal | <https://launchpad.apps.arena.fm2aihpcsed.com> |
| Admin dashboard | <https://launchpad-admin.apps.arena.fm2aihpcsed.com> |
| Backend API | <https://launchpad-api.apps.arena.fm2aihpcsed.com> |

The portal and API are protected by OpenShift OAuth. The deployment is managed by the `launchpad` Argo CD Application using `deploy/launchpad/overlays/arena`.

## Supported user journeys

### Individual environment

Use **Request Environment → Individual Lab** to provision one catalog item for one user.

### Multi-seat workshop

Use **Request Environment → Multi-seat Workshop** to order one workshop containing 1–25 isolated participant seats. Launchpad performs a capacity preview before confirmation, provisions seats concurrently, requires collective endpoint stability before declaring the workshop ready, and supports failed-seat retry and group reclaim.

### OpenShift Developer Sandbox

The `ai-sandbox` catalog item is OpenShift-first. Its primary access is the real OpenShift Console scoped to the generated namespace, with Web Terminal and browser IDE access where available. The requester receives the namespace-level `edit` role; Launchpad does not grant cluster-admin. Jupyter is not a default access method.

The shared Arena platform provides the centrally managed OpenShift capabilities used by catalog experiences. A sandbox or guided lab order receives namespace-scoped access and does not install cluster-wide operators.

The request form shows the live healthy model inventory and permits multiple
model selections. Models remain centrally served behind LiteLLM; the sandbox
receives scoped API access and does not load model weights into its pod.

## Active file-backed catalog

| ID | Name | Category |
|---|---|---|
| `ai-sandbox` | OpenShift Developer Sandbox | Open sandbox |
| `cpu-inference-serving` | LLM CPU Serving on Xeon | Quick start |
| `intel-llm-cpu-serving` | Intel AI Quickstart: Serve LLMs on Intel Xeon CPUs | Guided build |
| `intel-llm-tool-calling` | Intel AI Quickstart: LLM Tool Calling on Intel | Guided build |
| `intel-xeon6-agent-201` | Intel Xeon 6 201: Building an AI Agent | Guided build |
| `openshift-operators-workshop` | OpenShift AI Operator Workshop | Guided build |
| `rag-on-xeon` | RAG on Intel Xeon | Quick start |
| `smoke-test` | Smoke Test Demo | Quick start |

Catalog definitions live under `catalog/*/catalog-item.yaml`. The previous `guided-rag-on-xeon` item is deprecated; new workshop orders use the operator-focused experience.

Draft onboarding candidates are registered but intentionally hidden from the
order flow until runtime and live certification gates pass:

| ID | Name | Current gate |
|---|---|---|
| `agentops-observability` | AgentOps in Production: End-to-End Observability with Red Hat AI | Internal one-seat journey and TLS PostgreSQL-backed MLflow are live; pipeline TLS and production Logging storage block the five-seat gate |

Launchpad has adapters for mock, local, direct OpenShift, and RHDP modes.
**Direct OpenShift mode is the deployed Arena path.** RHDP/AgnosticD integration
remains repository capability and a useful source contract for importing labs;
it is not the runtime control plane for the internal Intel deployment. The
AgentOps import analysis is in
[docs/agentops-rhdp-gap-analysis.md](docs/agentops-rhdp-gap-analysis.md).

## Repository layout

```text

frontend/      Partner portal
admin/         Internal operations UI
catalog/       Active file-backed catalog definitions

deploy/        Kustomize, build, and optional RHDP/AgnosticV assets

```

## Development and verification

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest -q backend/tests

cd frontend
npm test -- --run
npm run build
```

New catalog experiences must include tests for their schema, request contract,
provisioning plan, functional validation, Showroom journey, and deterministic
cleanup. Follow the staged CI checklist in
[docs/persona-onboarding.md](docs/persona-onboarding.md#content-integrator-ci-onboarding)
and declare new sources through
[docs/catalog-onboarding.md](docs/catalog-onboarding.md).

Use Arena's dedicated kubeconfig for every cluster command; do not change the current kubeconfig context:

```bash
KUBECONFIG=/Users/jkershaw/.kube/config-arena oc ...
```

## Current limitations

- Existing Guided RAG sessions retain their original content; new orders use the OpenShift AI Operator Workshop.
- Operator availability is cluster-wide and centrally managed; catalog items should detect and use installed capabilities rather than install an Operator per participant seat.
- Some older files in `docs/` describe the original RHDP/infra01 target. Files explicitly labeled **historical** are design references, not the Oberon production contract.
- Repository-wide lint currently includes pre-existing React purity errors in `BrandingContext.tsx` and `Fleet.tsx`.

For certified multi-seat behavior and the current visual release gate, see
[docs/oberon-workshop-readiness.md](docs/oberon-workshop-readiness.md). Deferred
performance, ETA, automation, and scale pathways are tracked in
[docs/next-iteration-roadmap.md](docs/next-iteration-roadmap.md). For adapter
behavior, see [docs/adapters.md](docs/adapters.md). StarGate, DeepField, and
GeoLux production-candidate paths are defined in
[docs/production-solution-pathways.md](docs/production-solution-pathways.md).
